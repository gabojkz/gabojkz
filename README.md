### 🎨 Interests
When I'm not at my terminal, you can find me staying active or exploring creative outlets:

* 🧠 I am a INTP type, always vacuuming up knowledge philosophy, art, culture, and a bit of everything in between.
* ☕ Hot chocolate enthusiast.
* 🎮 My all-time favorite game: Half-Life the original of course.
* 💬 I enjoy deep conversations and sharing ideas, even the weird ones.
* 🧟 Fun fact: a little bit of a sugar zombie.
